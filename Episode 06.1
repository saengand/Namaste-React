we are going to solve the swiggys api issue
we where an integrating an API to fetch live data
from swiggy and 
we are displaying it on our food ordering app 

so what happend was that API which swiggy had got changed
and now there is new api
not a new api basically the api is the same 
but the format of the data which it gives has changed 
and now the code that I wrote last time is not working
anymore
and lot of students are facing issues because of that

so this video is for to solve those issue and explain
you how to fetch the api and get an the data

also 

just go to last video code 
go to Body.js -- in body component -- fetch data function
that was asyn function -- over here we made a fetch call
and this was the swiggy api, which we are callig 

when we return the data, we were converting that data into 
the json and then we were extracting this list of 
cards from the data 

the problem is working with live data is they are keep on changing

go to swiggy.com website
go to inspect element
