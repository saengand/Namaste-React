everything will do in html,css,javascript
which we can do in reactjs

then what/why react?

the beauty of using framework/libraries is that
it makes developer experience easy

it makes you write less code and do more on the webpage

Eposide 05 - part 01 -- we are learning react hook

before that we are clean our app

created src folder and 
source code our app in the src folder 
moved App.js into src folder 

change the path inside index.html

exports :   1) default export
            2) named export

            when in a single file we have to export multiple things 

            but with default export we can use it single time

            by default, a file can only export 1 thing

            suppose we have to export multiple things, then we use named export

            so we can write export infornt of variable or constants

imports:    named exports imported like -- 
            import {CDN_LINK} from "";
...48.45

Part 02 

we are make out website interactive 
by adding some features to it

        we are going to create a feature 
        create a button over here
        onclick of the button -- we will get top rated restaurant
        top rated restaurant -- having rating greater than 4 stars
    
    need to implement event handler

    go to body component -- Body.js
    at the place of search -- make it as button with class name filter
  
    we have used callback function onClick on button 

now change onClick to onMouseOver




1:06:37
created listOfRestaurants -- array of objects

1:02:26
we are having 2 layers in ui -- ui layer and data layer
UI layer will display what will send by Data layer

in my data layer, we are having 2 objects 
ui will display 2 cards

now suppose, we somehow my listofrestaurant modifies to 1 restaurant , my listofRestaurant filter to 1 restaurant

what will happen?
then ui will automatically show 1 restaurant right?

commented moMouseOver inside button
writing onClick2 again with filter logic 
so logic is res.info.avgRating > 4 


59:24 -- after clicking on -- top rated drestaurants -- we got an error -- Assignment to an constant variable , so change const to let -- so now its 
let listOfRestaurants

after this we can click again top rated restaurants button
we can see on console, we are getting restaurants which is having avgRating > 4 but not on UI

lets create 1 more restaurants, now after clicking top rated restaurants, we will get 2 restaurants on console only

but the UI is not updated
how do i update my ui?

so don't you think my listofRestaurants chagnes then it should have automatically changed in ?
over here my listofRestaurant(filter) changes so automatically this should have changed in listofRestaurant(map)

so on ui if it done automatically then how cool it would be correct? instead of writing logic?

this is the super power which react has.
when we say react is fast, react is fast in dom manipulation
react is efficient in dom manipulation
this is exact problem that react is solving 

suppose if you have to keep your data and UI layer consistent or bind or tied to each other 
that where React comes into picture 
or all the other frameworks angular, vue, react trying to solve this - that UI layer and data layers are work 
with each other 

if my data changes then UI layer also changes
so this is the thing which all this frameworks are tryign to solve, updating the DOM efficiency 

You know why react is fast?
    because it can do faster DOM manipulation
    it can do efficent DOM manupulation

there is something known as Virtual DOM, 
there is something known as deep algorithm
there is somehting know as reconsiliation

55:11 we will talk about all this later 

but first up all the problem which we are facing now 
we can see the update is happening in data layer but not reflecting same in UI layer 

after clicking on top rated restaurants button we can get updated UI, which we are not getting right now

my UI is tied to listOfRestaurants so, automatically it should change 

to do this, react give a super power 
right now the listOfRestauarants is normal javascript let variable

but if we give super powers of react to listofRestaurant, it will became a super energetic react variable 

now I want to create a super powerful react variable.
how do we created a super powerful react variable

we can called it as state variable in react
so basically it is like a state of variable
state is keyword its lingo in react
its a ssuper powerful variable

so for that we used hooks

react element - its plane js object
similarly a react hook - its also normal js function
this react hook function will come with some super powerful function

that function has written some background logic behind this

who wrote this logic - its written by react developer inside node-modules -  react folder
we did npm install react -- so all this utilities functions fot installed

how do I use it?

1) useState - its a utitlity superpower state variable in react
we have to import hook from react
import useState from 'react';

we have to import like named import 
means 
import {useState} from 'react'
2) useEffect - 

why we called it as state variable
because it maintain the state of variable
it maintain state of your component

so we are saying it as local state variable 
it scope is inside the component

so now how can we write it?
const [listOfRestaurants] = useState();

commented below listOfRestaurants because name is same.

now listOfRestaurants which is inside const is super powerful react variable

we have created listOfRestaurants(above) which is same as the listOfRestaurants(below)

normal js variable: 
    let listOfRestaurants 
react state variable:
    const [listOfRestaurants] = useState();

so initially for normal js variable, we are assignning empty array like
let listOfRestaurants = [];

similar in case of react state variable, with empty array like
const [listOfRestaurants] = useState([]);

if we want to pass default value as null instead of empty array
so we can write like
let listOfRestaurants = null;
and 
const [listOfRestaurants] = useState([]);

suppose we want to give default as 1 restaurant then
const [listOfRestaurants] = useState([{
    info:{
        .....
        .....
    }
}])

so this is how we pass default values to react variable using useState hook

we have changed listOfRestaurants(below) to
listOfRestaurantsJS 

written the info of 1 card inside useState([{
    info:{
        '''''
    }
}])

so we can see 1 card is appearing on UI
so it working same as previous listOfRestaurantsJS(below)

now we have written remaining all
40:14-----
so useState is giving the listOfRestaurants like this 
make sure to add listOfRestaurants inside an arraay
const [listOfRestaurants]
and I can use listOfRestaurants here-- using map
means we are getting all 3 cards on ui

Q)but how to modify the listOfRestaurants
-> by a function -- so here we are having setListOfRestaurants 

const [listOfRestaurants , setlistOfRestaurants] = useState([{

}])

so setlistOfRestaurants is for the update a list
now suppose if we click on the top Rated Restaurants button, then I want to update my listOfRestaurants

so we can not to update equally like this 
onClick={()=>{
                listOfRestaurants = listOfRestaurants.filter(
                  (res) => res.info.avgRating > 4
                )

this is not a proper way to update a state variable
so how do I update my state variable is? I will call setlistOfRestaurants() and pass new data and push inside it

let me just make it empty as of now - commented the listOfRestaurants filter part

so now I have to pass this filte part inside the setlistOfRestaurants()

once again recap
36.07----
you can create a normal variable like this 
let list = [];
this is empty list
we can update using 
list = ["abc"]
or list.push("avc");
but in this super powerful react variable listOfRestaurants
whenever we need to update listOfRestaurants
first up of all we need to create like this 
const [listOfRestaurants,setlistOfRestaurants] = useState([{}]);
giving some default value inside useState();
suppose i want to update the value of listOfRestaurants
we cant modify directly using ==
so we have used setlistOfRestaurants() method to update

suppose we have to make our listOfRestaurants as empty
so we can de setlistOfRestaurants([]);
so our listOfRestaurants will be now empty

now we are passing the filteredList inside the setlistOfRestaurants(filteredList)

now we can check our UI
so we can see 3 restourants
because we are passing all 3 restaurants as default inside useState so thats why we can see all 3

now we will click - top rated restaurants 
so will get updated UI with 2 restaurants
so our got filtered automatically

so this super powerful variable sync the data layer and ui layer

so as soon as my listOfRestaurants changes, it will automatically refresh our component
and this is known as Render

whenever a state variable updates , react re renders the components 
whenerver a state variable changes, react re renders the components 

what is mean by re renders?
if i am clicking on the top rated restaurants button , i am changing the state variable and the react is re rendering the components 

basically what it is doing is 

whenever setlistOfRestaurants() is get called, react remove the body component and update it properly

now we can use mockData here 
we have imported resList  from mockData.js
now we will pass this mock reslist inside useState as default value 

so as soon as my state variable updates, 
react will re render my components 

react will do this all in very optimize way, with very less code and 

so when we say react is super fast 
so react will do this dom operation super fast and effeiecently

how react is doing this all?
 when we click the butoon top rated restaurant
 automagically it got render
 how the react work with data and ui layer 

1:45:14 so lest go----- 
let me explain teh react alogorithm, 
Reconciliation Algorithm
this algo is also known as React Fiber

on the UI, we have a DOM 
DOM is like a tree 
tags are like a tree 
suppose this is res container 
this res container having 15 restaurants cards
so now what will happen is
now suppose my ui changes to fultering the 7 cards to 3 cards 
so first react will create Virtual DOM object
what is the virtual dom?
virtual dom is not a actual dom
what is the actual dom?
actual dom are tages 
suppose we have <div><div></div></div> this is actual dom
virtual dom is the represention of actual dom
so this virtual dom basically an noraml js object
whatever we are code we have written inside body component in return section
it will be store/read as object

if we will do console to body tag to inside App.js 
on consoel we will get the boject of body taag
so this is the virtual dom

virtual dom is the nested object

Deep Algorithm
it finds out the difference between 2 virtual dom , updated vdom and previous dom

suppose i have a resto container 
this resto container has 7 resto cards
afte clicking on the top rated button we got fillterd data with 3 resto cards 

so deep algo finds out the difference between previous vdom and update vdom
so difference is here for 4 node
so deep algo calculates this diffence and it will update the actual dom
on every render cycle 

so lets revise again

this react fiber came in react 16
search for the same React Fiber Architecture, Reconciliation

const [listOfRestaurants,setlistOfRestaurants] = useState();

this about const [] is basically array destructuring 

we can write it as 
const arr = useState(resList);
const [listOfRestaurants,setlistOfRestaurants] = arr;

const listOfRestaurants = arr[0];
const setlistOfRestaurants = arr[1];

so we are just destructuring above
